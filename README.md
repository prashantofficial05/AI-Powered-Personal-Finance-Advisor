### AI-Powered-Personal-Finance-Advisor

**Introduction:**

  An AI-driven application designed to analyze personal spending patterns and provide tailored financial advice. 
  By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), the advisor helps users understand their 
  finances better, predict future expenses, and offer personalized budgeting tips through an interactive chatbot 
  interface.
  
  **Goal:**
  
  To empower individuals with personalized financial insights by analyzing their transaction history, 
  interpreting their financial queries using NLP, and delivering actionable advice via a user-friendly chatbot.

**Description:**
   - **Define Scope:** Focus on analyzing personal financial transactions to understand spending habits and 
         provide customized advice.
   - **Data Collection:** Utilize publicly available financial data and anonymized transaction datasets.
        Dataset columns include:
        - Date/Time:  Timestamp of each transaction.
        - Mode: Payment  method (e.g., cash, credit card, online transfer).
        - Category:  Main expense category (e.g., food, utilities, entertainment).
        - Subcategory:  Specifics within a category (e.g., groceries, dining out).
        - Income/Expense: Indicator of money earned or spent.
        - Debit/Credit: Amount debited or credited.
   - **Data Preprocessing:**

       - Clean data by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
       - Convert dates to appropriate formats.
       - Encode categorical variables.
       - Feature engineering to create new insights (e.g., monthly averages, spending trends).

   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

      - Analyze spending habits over time.
      - Identify top spending categories and subcategories.
      - Visualize income versus expenses.
      - Detect anomalies or unusual spending patterns
        
   - **Machine Learning Model:**

      - Objective: Predict future expenses and provide financial advice.
      - Models Used:
            Time Series Analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) for forecasting expenses.
            Classification models (e.g., Random Forest) for categorizing spending behavior.
      - Output: Personalized advice like "Your utility expenses have increased by 15% this month."

  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

     - Implement NLP to interpret user financial queries.
     - Techniques:
     - Tokenization and lemmatization.
     - Intent recognition to understand user questions.
     - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract financial terms and dates.
     - Libraries Used: NLTK or spaCy.
 - **Chatbot Development:**

    - Framework: Use platforms like Rasa or Dialogflow.
    - Features:
    - Respond to user queries in natural language.
    - Provide spending summaries and forecasts.
    - Offer budgeting tips based on user data.
    - Interface: Simple and intuitive for ease of interaction.
  - **Integration and Deployment:**

    - Backend: Set up APIs to handle data processing and model predictions.
    - Frontend: Develop a user interface using Flask or Streamlit.
    - Deployment: Host the application on cloud services like AWS or Heroku.
   
       
**Skills:**
   - Machine Learning: Time series forecasting, classification algorithms.
   - Natural Language Processing: Intent recognition, entity extraction.
   - Programming Languages: Python.
   - Frameworks and Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, sci-kit-learn, NLTK/spaCy, Flask, Rasa/Dialogflow.
   - Chatbot Development: Designing conversational interfaces.
   - Deployment: Cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku.
     
**Metrics:**
   - Prediction Accuracy: Measure the accuracy of expense forecasts.
   - User Engagement: Track interactions with the chatbot.
   - Response Time: Evaluate the speed of query processing.
   - User Satisfaction: Collect feedback on the usefulness of advice.
   - Anomaly Detection Rate: Effectiveness in identifying unusual spending.
   


**Summary:**

   The AI-Powered Personal Finance Advisor leverages machine learning and NLP to provide individuals with 
   personalized financial insights. By analyzing transaction data, it helps users understand their spending 
   habits, forecasts future expenses, and offers budgeting advice through an interactive chatbot. This tool aims
